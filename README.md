# Event After All ! From THP, Week 6

Ready to take part from the Event After All ? Made with weird code from Caen. 
By Dylan Langlois (Dylan LH on Slack) & Salom√© d'Audeteau (Fihiz on Slack)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll have to practice the famous Bundle Install. Then a cool db:create, to finish with a bad db:migrate.


## Running the tests

A coooooool Rspec (which with any doubt, doesn't really work...)

## Built With

* Love
* Shit code
