# Event After All ! From THP, Week 6

Ready to take part in the Event After All ? Made with weird code from Caen.

By Dylan Langlois (Dylan LH on Slack) & Salomé d'Audeteau (Fihiz on Slack)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
* You'll have to practice the famous Bundle Install. 
* Then a cool db:create.
* You can now practice with a bad db:migrate!

* Please create a new user and then a new event to run the app.
  Go into the rails console for it! 
* If you do not have any inspiration, please copy and paste the following lines for user : User.create(email:"sam@yopmail.com", encrypted_password:"lolol", description:"Nulle en tout, bonne à rieeeen. Vive le code", first_name:"Sam", last_name:"Samsam")

* For event : Event.create(start_date:"2019-02-14 19:00:00 +0100", duration:3600, title:"Event semi-cool, semi-pourri", description:"Viens participer à notre super event", price:5, location:"Warpzone")

## Running the tests

A coooooool Rspec des familles (which with any doubt, doesn't really work...)

## Built With

* Love
* Shit code
